			            <h1>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang</h1>
			            <p>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game designed for mobile phones. 
                     The game is free-to-play and is only monetized through in-game purchases like characters and skins.
                     Each player can control a selectable character, called a Hero, with unique abilities and traits.</p>
